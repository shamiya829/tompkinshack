# Tompkins Hack Club

Over the past four decades, Tic Tac Toe has become an increasingly competitive event recognized by many of the TOP 20 colleges in the United States. Because of this, the TATASHASHA company is working to develop a multi-billion user platform for Tic Tac Toe lovers across the globe. We predict a 50 billion profit per year with profit generated from ads. If you are interested in sponsoring this project, you may email: johnthepilgrim@gmail.com
